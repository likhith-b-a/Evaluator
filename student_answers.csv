Anu,It is the process of collecting and analyzing data,Descriptive is about showing data while inferential is about making guesses from it,7,The formula is standard deviation = square root of (sum of (x - mean)^2 / N),Equal width and equal depth,6,When P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B),Bayes theorem is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B),It is P(A) times P(B given A),It is Q3 minus Q1
Ravi,Statistics is the study of data,Descriptive describes data, inferential draws conclusions,7,sqrt of (x minus mean) square over N,Two methods: equal width bins, equal depth bins,6,If two events don’t affect each other they are independent,It is P(A|B)=P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B),When A and B depend, use conditional probability,Interquartile range is the difference between Q3 and Q1
Priya,Studying data and drawing insights from it,Descriptive shows what’s happening, inferential guesses what will happen,7,Standard deviation is root of average of square of deviations,Equal width histogram and equal height histogram,6,Events A and B are independent when their joint probability equals product of individual probabilities,Bayes rule formula is P(A|B)=P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B),It becomes P(A)*P(B given A),Q3 - Q1 gives interquartile range
